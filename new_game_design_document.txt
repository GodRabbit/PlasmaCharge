New damage types:
Inferno
Frost
Nature
Thunder

The way the new system works:
each monster has weakneses and strengths that are constant [i.e do not change from 1 playthrough to the next]
instead of just attacking you can spend charge [10%??] to reveal 1 weakness or resistance of the monster, but it costs a turn

The combat is turn based, TRUE turn based.
